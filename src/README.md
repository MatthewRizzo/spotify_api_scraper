# Source Code Readme

Used to store the todo's and info that is more opaque for the end user

## TODO

* get % genre in playlist
  * maybe also had a piece that shows what genres each artist is
* implement state check during auth
    * better secure against XSS
* Add the image of each playlist to the playlist table
* have clicking on pie chart link to the artist/album itself
* make end url's not show the long params
* Make tab to list artist : genre(s)
  * gets ALL artists from ALL of the user's playlists and displays it
* When loading results of analysis, **bring to loading screen??** / say "please wait this might take a bit"?
